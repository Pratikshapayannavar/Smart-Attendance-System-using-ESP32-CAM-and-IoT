# Smart-Attendance-System-using-ESP32-CAM-and-IoT
This project implements an automated attendance system using the ESP32-CAM module for live image capture and Python with OpenCV and face_recognition libraries for processing. It captures images from the ESP32-CAM over WiFi, detects faces, recognizes known individuals, and logs their attendance into a CSV file with Name, Date, and Time.
